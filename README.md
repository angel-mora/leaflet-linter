# Leaflet Linter

> Microverse Capstone project. This is a Code Linter developed with Ruby to keep your Leaflet maps out of trouble. Includes tests for HTML, JS, JSON and GEOJSON files to get the most out of this amazing library.

Leaflet.js is an awesome library to create interactive web maps. It's so easy that errors are easy to fix. Leaflet-linter was designed to improve even more the experience of working with multiple layers and more complex maps by providing suggestions to style code and avoid future issues.

This linter must be used just after W3 HTML Validator and ESLint. It's not a substitute but a complement of them.
